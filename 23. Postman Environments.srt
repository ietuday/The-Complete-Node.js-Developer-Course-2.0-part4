1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,640
Before we get back to creating our express routes we're going to take a quick moment to explore a feature

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,460
of post man that's going to make it a lot easier to switch between your local environment and the Heroku

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,710
application.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,530
This is called post man environments.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:21,270
Now in order to illustrate this I am going to start up my local server by running node server server

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,980
J.S. and over inside of post.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,370
We're going to start making a few requests now if you remember in the last video we made a request to

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:37,320
our Heroku application I clicked send on the get to Doo's you Arel and I get the two do's back as expected.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,080
The problem is that over here the actual items saved in the collection and they all use that localhost

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,830
you are Owl and there's no good way to switch between the two.

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,690
To fix this issue we're going to create environments one for our local machine and one for Heroku.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,530
And this is going to let us create a variable as the are Owl and we can change that variable by flicking

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,080
a switch over here in the environments dropdown to illustrate exactly how this is going to work.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,990
I am going to be copying the Heroku you are all right now and then I'm going to head over to the know

15
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,040
environment dropdown and click manage environments.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,940
Here we currently have none but we can go ahead and add it to the first environment.

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to call to do app local.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,540
This is going to be the local to do application and we can set up a set of key value pairs.

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,640
Now the only key We're going to set is you are all we're going to set a local host you are all for the

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,000
to do app local environment and we'll set the Heroku you are Al for the to do app Heroku environment

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,300
which will create in just a socket right here local host Colan three thousand.

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,560
We're leaving off path's because that is going to depend on the individual route.

23
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to go ahead and add in that environment then we can create a second one.

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,320
This one will be called to do app Heroku and we're going to set the U R L key once again this time though

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,330
we're setting it equal to the value I copy to the clipboard.

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,510
This is the Heroku application you are out.

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,730
I'm going to add that now we have our two environments and I can close that window manager.

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm going to close all of my tabs and I'm not going to make any changes by saving then I'm going to

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,110
go to get to do's.

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,410
Now currently get to deuse automatically fetches from localhost.

31
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,860
But we're going to do is replace the U R L everything before the slash with the following syntax which

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,460
will look similar if you're familiar with any templating engines.

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,030
Curly braces followed by the variable name u r l followed by two closing braces.

34
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,730
This is going to inject the u r l right here meaning that the get to Duzer Quest is now dynamic.

35
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,550
We can change which endpoint requests from localhost or Heroku based on the environment.

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm going to save this request and fire it off.

37
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,070
And you'll notice when you try to fire this request we get an error.

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,770
It's trying to make a request to a u r l that starts with the curly braces.

39
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,530
This is the uncoated character you R-AL the closing curly braces and to Dewes That's because the U R

40
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,530
L variable is currently not defined.

41
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,510
We need to switch to an environment over in the environments list we now have to do app Heroku and to

42
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,800
do app local.

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,320
If I click to do app local and send that request off what do I get.

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,610
I get my two items in the local database.

45
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,690
If I switch over to to do app Heroku this is going to make a request to the Heroku application it's

46
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,260
going to be updating this you R-AL and when I fire it off we get a different set of data this time around.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,940
All we have is our 1 to do item and the one that's available on the Heroku application.

48
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,400
With this in place get to Dewes can now easily be used to fetch local host or Heroku items and we can

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,460
do the same thing with our post to request right here I'm going to replace the R L with the curly braces

50
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,850
and inside of those curly braces will have the U R L variable.

51
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,890
Now I can go ahead and save this request fire it off and it's going to make a new to do on the Heroku

52
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,830
application.

53
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:16,550
If I switch to the local environment we can fire that off and now we have a new do on the local environment.

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,740
The last request to change is going to be the get to do is by ID request.

55
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,890
We're going to take that localhost three thousand.

56
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,590
Once again then we're going to go ahead and replace it with.

57
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,230
You are out.

58
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,540
Just like this.

59
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,340
And now we are done we can save the request and we can go ahead and fire it off.

60
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,310
Now this one has a second variable.

61
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,180
This is the actual to do ID.

62
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,020
You could add this as a variable as well.

63
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,240
For now though since it's going to change as we add and delete to Dewes I'm going to simply grab one

64
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,860
from the local database move into the get to Doo's requests swap it out here and send it off and we

65
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,540
get to do back.

66
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,610
If I make it a to do object id that doesn't exist by changing one of the numbers to 6.

67
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:07,040
We get a 404 everything is still working as expected and it's also going to work on the Heroku environment.

68
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,950
I'm going to fetch all the dues on the Heroku environment grab one of the Ids.

69
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:19,490
Move to the get to do by ID request swap out the ID send it off and we get that to do item.

70
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,640
Hopefully you're starting to see why these postman environments are so convenient you can easily switch

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,320
between two environments changing exactly what happens to the request.

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,970
Now in this case we happened to only have one variable you are Al you could add others and we will a

73
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,220
little bit later.

74
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,330
For now though that is it.

75
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,200
We have a way to swap between the two environments inside of postman.

76
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,490
Now that we have this in place we're going to move back into the Adam editor and we're going to start

77
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,630
adding new routes.

78
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,960
There's two more to go in the next video.

79
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,270
You're going to learn how to delete to do's by ID.

80
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,100
That's coming up next.

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,160
So stay tuned.

82
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
I will see you then
