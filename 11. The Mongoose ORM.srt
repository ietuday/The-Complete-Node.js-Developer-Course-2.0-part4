00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,970
In the last several videos you learn how to use the Mongo D-B native driver and that let you create

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,450
and it update and delete documents from here on out.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,660
We're also going to be using something called mongoose mongoose which is an O R M standing for object

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,640
relational mapping is a fantastic NPM library.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,010
It makes it really easy to structure your data.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,290
For example in this app we're going to have to do's and users to do needs certain things it needs certain

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,410
properties of certain types maybe we want to add some custom validation for them for the user for example

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,620
we need to validate their password.

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,200
All of this is a lot easier with mongoose in place.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,580
Is it possible that mongoose.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,990
Yes it is.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,980
You can do everything.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,250
Mongoose can do with a mango divi native driver but instead of writing all that boilerplate code yourself

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,040
most people prefer to use mongoose to get the job done.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,770
Let's go ahead and start integrating it into our node code.
