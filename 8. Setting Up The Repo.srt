1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,010
Before we go any further I do want to add a version control to this project.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,900
In this video we're going to create a new repo locally.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,320
We'll make a new get hub repository and we'll push our code to that get how that repository.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,510
If you're already familiar with get or get hub you can go ahead and do that on your own you don't need

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,140
to watch this video if you're just getting started and you want to treat this video as a challenge.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,240
That's great too.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,350
I highly recommend taking this video as a challenge.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,250
If you're new to get and it doesn't make sense just yet that's fine.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,100
Also simply follow along and we'll go through the whole process.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,340
This one is going to be really simple nothing.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,740
Mongo DB related here to get started.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,350
I am going to go ahead and initialize a new get repository from the terminal using get in it which we

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,660
explored in the previous section.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,510
This is going to initialize a new repository and I can always run and get status like this to take a

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,760
look at the files that are on tracked right here we have our playground folder which we do want to add

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,840
under version control and we have packaged up Jason.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,650
We also have node modules we do not want to track this directory.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,370
This contains all of our NPM libraries to ignore node modules over inside of atom.

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,690
We're going to make that get ignore or file in the root of our project.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,570
If you remember this lets you specify files and folders that you want to leave out of your version control

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,710
right here.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,080
I'm going to create a new file.

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,140
Don't get ignore in order to ignore the node modules directory all we have to do is type it exactly

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,670
as it shown here.

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,100
Node.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,140
Underscore modules a forward slash.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,610
I'm going to save the file rerun and get status from the terminal and what do we get.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,660
We get the get.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,230
Ignore folder showing up any node modules folder is nowhere in sight.

30
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,280
The next thing we're going to do is make our first commit using two commands.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,560
First up I'm going to use GET add a dot to add everything to the next commit.

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,720
Then I can make that commit using a get commit with the M flag.

33
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,180
A good message for this commit would be and it commit.

34
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,420
Excellent.

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,160
Now before we go I do want to make a good home repository and get this code up there.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,740
That is going to require me to open up the browser and go to get hub dot com.

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,730
Once you're logged in we can make a new repo just like we did in the previous section.

38
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm going to make a new repo and give it a name.

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm going to go with a node course hyphen to to do API.

40
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,410
Excellent.

41
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,970
You can name your something else I'm going to go with this one to keep the course files organized.

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,780
Now I can go ahead and create this repository.

43
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,910
And as you remember you get how it actually gives us a few helpful commands in this case we're pushing

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,700
an existing repository from the command line.

45
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,290
We already went through the steps of initializing the repository outing our files and making our first

46
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:53,970
commit.

47
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:00,130
That means I can take these two lines copy them head over to the terminal and paste them in.

48
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,260
Now you might need to do these one at a time depending on your operating system.

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,770
On the Mac when I try to paste in multiple commands it's going to run all but the last and I just hit

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,810
enter to run the last one.

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,370
Take a moment to knock that out for your operating system you might need to run it as one command or

52
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,030
you may be able to paste it all in and hit enter.

53
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,100
Either way what we have here is our code pushed up to get hub.

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,220
I can prove that it's pushed up by refreshing the repository page and right here we have all of our

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,700
source code they get in your filed package.

56
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,110
Jason and we have our playground directory with our Mongo DB scripts.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,080
That is it for this one.

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,780
As promised this one is simple Sure and unrelated to Mongo D-B itself.

59
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,620
I'll see you next time.

60
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,610
As we explore how to delete data from a mongo IDB collection
