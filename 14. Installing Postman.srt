00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,270
This video you're going to learn how to use post ma'am.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,630
Postman isn't a central tool if you're building a rest API.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,930
I have never worked with a team or on a project where post man was not heavily used by every developer

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,900
involved.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,140
Postman lets you create HTP requests and fire them off.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,440
That makes it really easy to test that everything you're writing is working as expected.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,560
Now obviously we will also be writing automated tests but using postman lets you play around with data

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,980
and see how things work as you move through your API.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,120
It really is a fantastic tool to grab it.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,250
We're going to head over to the browser and go to get post man and dot com.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,650
And here we can grab their chrome application.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,940
Now if you're not using Chrome you are going to need to install it although you don't have to use the

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,100
Chrome browser.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,290
All you have to do is install Chrome to install the app.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,320
Open up postman and you never have to use Chrome again.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,790
If you already use Chrome great.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,150
Go ahead and install that.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,580
If you are on a Mac they just introduced a Mac app.

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,040
It is a great alternative.

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,110
It has all the same features it's just bundled differently instead of opening Chrome to open postman.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,210
You can just open the app from Spotlight like I can here.

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,150
Hey what's going on.

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,320
It's and you're from the future with a quick interruption.

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,160
If you go over to the post man Web site you're going to notice there's no longer a chrome app download

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,030
option.

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,190
That's because Google Chrome is deprecating the entire idea of a chrome application.

27
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,760
So that whole ecosystem is going away.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,180
But that's perfectly fine because post man has released applications for all operating systems.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,370
So whether you're on Mac whether you're on Windows or Linux you can find the native application for

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,630
your operating system.

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,790
It's the exact same app it's just specific to your OS.

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,530
So go ahead and grab the one for your system.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,290
Then we can just go ahead and continue on as usual.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,220
All right let's jump back in to the regular video.

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,300
Now I'm going to be using the chrome application since that's most likely what you'll be using if you're

36
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,310
not on a Mac to install it.

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,970
All you have to do is install the chrome app from the Chrome store click add to Chrome and it should

38
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,790
bring you over to the page where you can open up the application.

39
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,030
Now to open up chrome apps you have to go to this kind of weird you are Alex chrome colon forward slash

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,160
forwards slash apps here.

41
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,590
You can view all of your apps and we can just open up postman by clicking it.

42
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,570
Now as I mentioned post man lets you make HTP requests so we're going to go ahead and make a few to

43
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,490
play around with the user interface.

44
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,280
You do not need to make an account and you do not need to sign up for a paid plan that paid plans are

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,680
targeted towards teams of developers who need advanced features.

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,500
We are just making basic requests on our machine.

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,090
We don't need cloud storage or anything like that.

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,420
I'm going to skip account creation and we go right to the application here.

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
We can set up our request.

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,930
This is what happens in the panel right here and down below in the whitespace will be able to view the

51
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,800
result.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,350
Let's go ahead and make a request to Google in the you are Albar I'm going to type HTP call.

53
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,120
Forward slash.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,970
Forward slash.

55
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,900
Google dot com.

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,590
We can click send it to send off that request.

57
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,930
Make sure you have get chosen as your HTP method.

58
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,480
When I fire off the request it comes back and all of the data that comes back is shown below.

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,130
We have things like the status code.

60
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,650
We have a 200 here meaning things went great.

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,160
We have the time it took about a quarter of a second.

62
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,440
We have headers.

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,890
These are coming back from Google we have cookies.

64
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,310
There is none in this case and we have our body data the body for google.com is an H TNL Web site for

65
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,570
the most part the bodies that will be sending and getting in post man are going to be Jason since we're

66
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,570
building out that rest a P.I. so to illustrate how Jason data works we're going to make a request to

67
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,910
the geocoding you are out that we used earlier in the course.

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,150
If you remember we were able to pass in a location and we got some Jason back describing things like

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,190
the latitude and longitude and the formatted address.

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,960
Now this should still be in your Krown history if you deleted your history.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:11,660
You can go ahead and go to Google API is right here this is the you are I'll I'll be using you can simply

72
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,820
copy it or you can grab any Jason API.

73
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,760
You are out.

74
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,270
I'm going to grab this one.

75
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,490
Copy it to the clipboard.

76
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,770
Head back into post man and swap out the L with the you are at I just copied.

77
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,780
Now I can go ahead and fire off the request.

78
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,860
And what do we get.

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,420
We get our Jason and data down below.

80
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,070
And this is fantastic.

81
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,870
We're able to see exactly what comes back when we make this request and this is how we're going to be

82
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,290
using postman will use postman to make requests to add to do's delete to do's get all of our to do's

83
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,180
log in.

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,310
All of that stuff is going to happen right in here.

85
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,740
Remember API.

86
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,120
They don't necessarily have a front end.

87
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,720
Maybe it's an Android app maybe it's an iPhone app or a web app.

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,560
Maybe it's a nother server so post man give us a way to interact with our API making sure it works as

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,610
expected.

90
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,680
Here we have all of the Jason data that comes back in the raw view which is underbody.

91
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,690
We have the raw data response.

92
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,060
Essentially it's just an prettified.

93
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,810
There is no formatting there is no colorization.

94
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,250
Also have a preview.

95
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,490
The preview is pretty useless for Jason when it comes to Jason data.

96
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,050
I always stick with the pretty tab which should be the default.

97
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,310
Now that we have post man installed and we know a little bit about how to use it we're going to move

98
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,490
on to the next video where we actually create our first request and we'll be firing off a post man request

99
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,290
to hit that you are all going to create.

100
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,470
This is going to let us make new to do's.

101
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:46,430
Right from post man or any other application whether it's a web app a mobile app or another server.

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,660
That's all coming up next.

103
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,430
So just make sure you have postman installed if you were able to do everything in this video you are

104
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,950
ready to continue on.

105
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,790
Stay tuned.

106
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,470
I will see you next time.
