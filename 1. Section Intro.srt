Hello and welcome to Section 7 Mongo D-B mongoose and rest.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,120
AP eyes in this section you're going to be building your very own rest API similar to the weather API

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,800
we used when we were building the weather app although instead of managing weather information you're

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,260
going to create an API that manages to do application which means we're going to need ways to create

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,450
delete complete and otherwise manage our data.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,650
Now in order to actually store this data we could use the file system but that's a really bad idea for

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,230
most applications.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,130
It's great when you're working with simple command line interfaces but for a real API like the one we're

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,560
going to build we want to use a real database and we're going to be using Mongo D-B to get that done.

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,250
Mongo D-B is a really popular No s ul database.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,940
We'll talk exactly about what all of that means later.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,260
But for now all you need to know is that it's going to let us persist user information as well as to

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,790
do information.

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,440
We're also going to be looking at Mongoose which is a library that makes it really easy to work with

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,520
Mongo D-B.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,380
But before we add on libraries and obscure things even further let's just stick to the fundamentals.

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,170
We're going to get started by installing Mongo and we'll spend a few videos going through exactly what

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,280
Mongo is and why it's become so popular.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,500
Let's go ahead and dive in.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,530
Installing the database software
